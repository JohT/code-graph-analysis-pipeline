# Code Graph Analysis Pipeline

<img src="./images/DALL-E-Mini-Graph-Pipeline-Logo.png" align="left" hspace="10" width="180">

Contained within this repository is a comprehensive and automated code graph analysis pipeline. While initially designed to support Java through the utilization of [jQAssistant](https://jqassistant.org/get-started), its capabilities extend beyond that particular language. The graph database [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) serves as the foundation for storing and querying the graph, which encompasses all the structural intricacies of the analyzed code. Additionally, Neo4j's [Graph Data Science](https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science) integration maximizes the utilization of its features. The generated reports offer flexibility, ranging from simple query results presented as CSV files to more elaborate Jupyter Notebooks converted to Markdown or PDF formats.

## 🛠 Prerequisites

- Java 11 is required (June 2023 Neo4j 4.x requirement)
- Python with a conda package manager is needed for Jupyter Notebook reports
- Chromium will automatically be downloaded if needed for Jupyter Notebook reports in PDF format.

## 🤔 Questions & Answers

- How can i run an analysis locally?  
  👉 See [start-an-analysis](./COMMANDS.md#start-an-analysis) in the [Commands Reference](./COMMANDS.md).

- How can i add an CSV report to the pipeline?  
  👉 Put your new cypher query into the [cypher](./cypher) directory or a suitable (new) sub directory.  
  👉 Create a new CSV report script in the [scripts/reports](./scripts/reports/) directory. Take for example [OverviewCsv.sh](./scripts/reports/OverviewCsv.sh) as a reference.  
  👉 The script will automatically be included because of the directory and its name ending with "Csv.sh".

- How can i add an Jupyter Notebook report to the pipeline?  
  👉 Put your new notebook into the [jupyter](./jupyter) directory.  
  👉 Create a new Jupyter report script in the [scripts/reports](./scripts/reports/) directory. Take [OverviewJupyter.sh](./scripts/reports/OverviewJupyter.sh) as a reference for example.  
  👉 The script will automatically be included because of the directory and its name ending with "Jupyter.sh".

- How can i add another code base to analyze?  
  👉 Create an new artifacts download script in the [scripts/artifacts](./scripts/artifacts) directory. Take [downloadAxonFramework.](./scripts/artifacts/downloadAxonFramework.sh) as a reference for example.  
  👉 The script will be triggered when the [analyze](./scripts/analysis/analyze.sh) command

- How can i trigger a full rescan of all artifacts?  
  👉 Delete the file `artifactsChangeDetectionHash.txt` in the temporary `artifacts` directory.

- How can PDF generation be skipped to speed up report generation and not depend on chromium?  
  👉 Set environment variable `SKIP_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PDF_GENERATION` to anything except an empty string. Example:  

  ```shell
  export SKIP_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PDF_GENERATION="true"
  ```
