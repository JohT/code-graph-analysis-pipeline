# Code Graph Analysis Pipeline

<img src="./images/DALL-E-Mini-Graph-Pipeline-Logo-2.png" align="left" hspace="10" width="180">

Contained within this repository is a comprehensive and automated code graph analysis pipeline. While initially designed to support Java through the utilization of [jQAssistant](https://jqassistant.org/get-started), it is open to extension for further programming languages. The graph database [Neo4j](https://neo4j.com) serves as the foundation for storing and querying the graph, which encompasses all the structural intricacies of the analyzed code. Additionally, Neo4j's [Graph Data Science](https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science) provides additional algorithms like community detection to analyze the code structure. The generated reports offer flexibility, ranging from simple query results presented as CSV files to more elaborate Jupyter Notebooks converted to Markdown or PDF formats.

### üìñ Graph Data Science Reports

Here are some reports that utilize Neo4j's [Graph Data Science Library](https://neo4j.com/product/graph-data-science). For a detailed reference of all CSV reports see [CSV Cypher Query Report Reference](#üìÉ-csv-cypher-query-report-reference) below. 

- [Community Detection with Leiden](./results/AxonFramework-4.8.0/community-csv/Leiden_Communities.csv) ([Source Script](./scripts/reports/CommunityCsv.sh))
- [Centrality with Page Rank](./results/AxonFramework-4.8.0/centrality-csv/Centrality_Page_Rank.csv) ([Source Script](./scripts/reports/CentralityCsv.sh))
- [Similarity with Jaccard](./results/AxonFramework-4.8.0/similarity-csv/Similarity_Jaccard.csv) ([Source Script](./scripts/reports/SimilarityCsv.sh))

## üõ† Prerequisites

- Java 17 is [required for Neo4j](https://neo4j.com/docs/operations-manual/current/installation/requirements/#deployment-requirements-software) (Neo4j 5.x requirement).
- On Windows it is recommended to use the git bash provided by [git for windows](https://gitforwindows.org).
- [jq](https://github.com/jqlang/jq) the "lightweight and flexible command-line JSON processor" needs to be installed. Latest releases: https://github.com/jqlang/jq/releases/latest. Check using `jq --version`.
- Set environment variable `NEO4J_INITIAL_PASSWORD` to a password of your choice. For example:
  ```shell
  export NEO4J_INITIAL_PASSWORD=neo4j_password_of_my_choice
  ```
  To run Jupyter notebooks, create an `.env` file in the folder from where you open the notebook containing for example: `NEO4J_INITIAL_PASSWORD=neo4j_password_of_my_choice`

### Further Prerequisites for Python and Jupyter Notebooks

- Python is required for Jupyter Notebook reports.
- A conda package manager like [Miniconda](https://docs.conda.io/projects/miniconda/en/latest) or [Anaconda](https://www.anaconda.com/download)(Recommended for Windows) is required for Jupyter Notebook reports.
- Chromium will automatically be downloaded if needed for Jupyter Notebook PDF reports generation.

### Further Prerequisites for Graph Visualization

These tools are needed to run the graph visualization scripts of directory [graph-visualization](./graph-visualization):

- [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en)
- [npm](https://www.npmjs.com)

### Hints for Windows

- Add this line to your `~/.bashrc` file if you are using Anaconda3: `/c/ProgramData/Anaconda3/etc/profile.d/conda.sh`. Try to find a similar script for other conda package managers or versions.
- Run `conda init` in the git bash opened as administrator. Running it in normal mode usually leads to an error message.

## ü§î Questions & Answers

- How can i run an analysis locally?  
  üëâ See [Start an analysis](./COMMANDS.md#start-an-analysis) in the [Commands Reference](./COMMANDS.md).

- How can i add a CSV report to the pipeline?  
  üëâ Put your new cypher query into the [cypher](./cypher) directory or a suitable (new) sub directory.  
  üëâ Create a new CSV report script in the [scripts/reports](./scripts/reports/) directory. Take for example [OverviewCsv.sh](./scripts/reports/OverviewCsv.sh) as a reference.  
  üëâ The script will automatically be included because of the directory and its name ending with "Csv.sh".

- How can i add a Jupyter Notebook report to the pipeline?  
  üëâ Put your new notebook into the [jupyter](./jupyter) directory.  
  üëâ Create a new Jupyter report script in the [scripts/reports](./scripts/reports/) directory. Take [OverviewJupyter.sh](./scripts/reports/OverviewJupyter.sh) as a reference for example.  
  üëâ The script will automatically be included because of the directory and its name ending with "Jupyter.sh".

- How can i add another code basis to be analyzed automatically?  
  üëâ Create a new artifacts download script in the [scripts/downloader](./scripts/downloader/) directory. Take for example [downloadAxonFramework.sh](./scripts/downloader/downloadAxonFramework.sh) as a reference.  
  üëâ Run the script separately before executing [analyze.sh](./scripts/analysis/analyze.sh) also in the [pipeline](./.github/workflows/code-structure-analysis.yml).

- How can i trigger a full rescan of all artifacts?  
  üëâ Delete the file `artifactsChangeDetectionHash.txt` in the `artifacts` directory.

- How can PDF generation for Jupyter Notebooks be enabled (depends on chromium, takes more time)?  
  üëâ Set environment variable `ENABLE_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PDF_GENERATION` to anything except an empty string. Example:  

  ```shell
  export ENABLE_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PDF_GENERATION="true"
  ```

  üëâ Alternatively prepend your command with `ENABLE_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PDF_GENERATION="true"` like:  
  
  ```shell
  ENABLE_JUPYTER_NOTEBOOK_PDF_GENERATION=true ./../../scripts/analysis/analyze.sh
  ```
