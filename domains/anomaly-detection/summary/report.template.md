### 📗 Cluster-Level Diagnostic Plots

| Plot | Description | Best For | Adds | Why |
|------|--------------|----------|------|-----|
| **Clusters – Overall** | Shows all clusters since they all fit into one plot. | Gaining a holistic view of cluster characteristics in the dataset. | An overall summary of how all clusters are distributed and their key metrics. | Understanding the general structure and properties of clusters can help identify patterns and potential anomalies in the data. |
| **Clusters – Largest Average Radius** | Ranks clusters by mean distance of members from their centroid. | Getting an overview of clusters that are more dispersed. | Identifies clusters with internal variability. | Large average radius suggests less cohesion and potential outliers. |
| **Clusters – Largest Max Radius** | Shows clusters with the farthest outlying member. | Identifying clusters that have members farthest from cluster center. | Highlights clusters containing extreme outliers. | Indicates clusters that may contain hidden anomalies. |
| **Clusters – Largest Size** | Displays cluster membership counts. | Understanding which clusters contain the most code units. | Provides sense of frequency of code structures. | Large clusters may represent common design patterns; small clusters are specialized. |
| **Cluster Probabilities** | Distribution of HDBSCAN membership probabilities. | Detecting code units that don’t strongly belong to any cluster. | Measures how well-defined clusters are. | Highlights noisy or weakly defined clusters. |

### 📒 Cluster Noise & Bridge Diagnostics

| Plot | Description | Best For | Adds | Why |
|------|--------------|----------|------|-----|

### 📕 Graph Visualizations (Archetype-Level Network Views)

| Plot | Description | Best For | Adds | Why |
|------|--------------|----------|------|-----|
| **Top Hub Graph Visualization** | Displays the most connected node (e.g., **#1 Hub**) at the center, surrounded by its direct dependencies. Incoming nodes show who is dependent on the hub. | Understanding highly connected code units or components that serve as central integrators. | Highlights nodes that act as major dependency aggregators. | Helps detect over-centralized modules or potential architectural bottlenecks. |
| **Top Bottleneck Graph Visualization** | Shows the node with the highest betweenness centrality (e.g., **#1 Bottleneck**) and its local neighborhood. | Identifying code units that control information or dependency flow. | Emphasizes nodes that mediate critical paths between modules. | Reveals single points of failure or routing constraints in dependency flow. |
| **Top Authority Graph Visualization** | Centers the most authoritative node (e.g., **#1 Authority**) with incoming and outgoing links from dependent nodes with high PageRank and emphasized PageRank to ArticleRank difference. | Detecting key knowledge or functionality providers. | Highlights components with high centrality. | Indicates structural or semantic “sources of truth” in the system. |
| **Top Bridge Graph Visualization** | Displays a node acting as a structural bridge between clusters (e.g., **#1 Bridge**) and its cross-cluster connections based on node embeddings encoding the Graph structure. | Understanding cross-cutting dependencies between modules. | Reveals links connecting distinct architectural domains. | Useful for spotting boundary leaks or undesired coupling between subsystems. |
| **Top Outlier Graph Visualization** | Centers an unusual or isolated node (e.g., **#1 Outlier**) that can hardly be assigned to a cluster and visualizes its sparse or unexpected dependency patterns. | Identifying structurally or behaviorally anomalous nodes. | Highlights nodes with rare or unexpected connection patterns. | Helps pinpoint code units that deviate from established dependency norms. |

> **Note:**
> - In all Graph Visualizations, the **central node** represents the selected *Top Archetype* (e.g., *Top 1 Hub*).  
> - **Darker nodes** indicate *incoming dependencies*, while **brighter nodes** indicate *outgoing dependencies*.  
> - **Emphasized nodes** (thicker borders or larger size) mark particularly influential or anomalous dependencies, depending on the archetype.  
> - These visualizations are most effective for interpreting *local dependency topology* and *role significance* of key components.

### 💡 Reading Guidance

- **Color Conventions:**  
  Red = anomalous, Green = typical, Light grey = noise, Pale colors = clusters.  
- **Scales:**  
  SHAP values are normalized (mean absolute); graph metrics standardized by z-score.  
- **How to Use:**  
  1. Start with *Main Diagnostic* plots to identify anomalies and drivers.  
  2. Use *Local SHAP* for detailed case analysis.  
  3. Check *Cluster Diagnostics* and *Noise Plots* to verify grouping quality.  
  4. Use *Feature Distributions* to contextualize metrics.  
  5. Cross-reference *Feature Relationships* for architectural interpretation.

## 4. Taxonomy of Anomaly Archetypes

| Archetype | Feature Profile | Architectural Risk |
|-----------|-----------------|--------------------|
| **Hub** | High degree, low clustering coefficient | Central dependency; fragile hotspot |
| **Bottleneck** | High betweenness, low redundancy | Single point of failure; slows evolution |
| **Outlier** | High cluster distance, small cluster size | Misfit or irregular dependency pattern |
| **Authority** | High PageRank, low ArticleRank | Over-relied utility; low local stability |
| **Bridge** | Cross-cluster connection | Risky coupling; weak modular boundaries |

**Structured form (for LLM parsing):**

```yaml
archetypes:
  - name: Hub
    profile: High degree, low clustering coefficient
    risk: Central dependency, fragile hotspot
  - name: Bottleneck
    profile: High betweenness, low redundancy
    risk: Single point of failure
  - name: Outlier
    profile: High cluster distance, small cluster size
    risk: Misfit component
  - name: Authority
    profile: High PageRank, low ArticleRank
    risk: Over-relied utility
  - name: Bridge
    profile: Cross-cluster connector
    risk: Risky coupling
```

## 5. Recommendations

* **Refactor hubs:** Decompose large or over-connected utilities.
* **Mitigate bottlenecks:** Introduce redundancy or alternative communication paths.
* **Investigate outliers:** Determine if anomalies are justified exceptions.
* **Raise cohesion:** Increase local clustering by improving modular boundaries.
* **Stabilize authorities:** Encapsulate frequently used but fragile components.
* **Validate bridges:** Confirm cross-cluster connectors are intentional and safe.
