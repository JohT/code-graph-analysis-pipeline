// Anomaly Detection Query: Find fragile structural bridges, potential boundary-spanning modules and cohesion violations by listing the top 20 entries with the highest Betweeenness centrality >= 90% percentile and a local clustering coefficient <= 10% percentile.
// Shows code that connects otherwise unrelated parts of the graph â€” potential architectural risks.
