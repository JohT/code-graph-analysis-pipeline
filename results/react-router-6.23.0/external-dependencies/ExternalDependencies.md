## External Package Usage

### External Package

An external type has no `byteCodeVersion` since it only occurs as a dependency but wasn't analyzed itself (missing bytecode). Core Java types like `java.lang.Integer` and primitives like `int` are considered "build-in" and therefore aren't interpreted as "external" even though their byte code is also missing. A package is categorized as "external" if the types it contains are classified as external.

### External annotation dependency

The aforementioned classification encompasses external annotation dependencies as well. These dependencies introduce significantly less coupling and are not indispensable for compiling code. Without the external annotation the code would most probably behave differently. Hence, they are included in the first more overall and general tables and then left out in the later more specific ones.

### Table 1 - Top 20 most used external packages overall

This table shows the external packages that are used by the most different internal types overall.
Additionally, it shows which types of the external package are actually used. External annotations are also listed.

Only the top 20 entries are shown. The whole table can be found in the following CSV report:
`External_package_usage_overall`

**Columns:**
- *externalPackageName* identifies the external package as described above
- *numberOfExternalCallerPackages* refers to the distinct packages that make use of the external package
- *numberOfExternalCallerTypes* refers to the distinct types that make use of the external package
- *numberOfExternalTypeCalls* includes every dependency to the types in the external package
- *numberOfExternalTypeCallsWeighted* includes every invocation or reference (sum of weights) to the types in the external package
- *allPackages* contains the total count of all analyzed packages in general
- *allTypes* contains the total count of all analyzed types in general
- *externalTypeNames* contains a list of actually utilized types of the external package

### Table 3 - Top 20 most widely spread external packages

The following tables shows external packages that are used by many different artifacts with the highest number of artifacts first. External annotations are filtered out to only get those external packages that significantly add to coupling.

Statistics like minimum, maximum, average, median and standard deviation are provided for the number of packages and number of types in every artifact that uses the listed external package. 

The intuition behind that is to find external package dependencies that are used in a widely spread manner. This should uncover libraries and frameworks and make it easier to distinguish them from external dependencies that are used for specific tasks. It can also be used to find external dependencies that are used sparsely regarding artifacts but are used in many different packages there. This could then be improved by applying a [Hexagonal architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture).

Only the top 20 entries are shown. The whole table can be found in the following CSV report:
`External_package_usage_spread`

**Columns:**
- *externalPackageName* identifies the external package as defined above. All other columns contain aggregated data for this external package.
- *numberOfArtifacts* contains the number of artifacts that use the external package
- *sumNumberOfPackages* contains the sum of all packages that use the external package

This gives an overview of the distribution of external package calls and the overall coupling to external libraries. The higher the count of distinct external packages the lower should be the count of types that use them. Dependencies to external annotations are left out here.

More details about which types have the highest external package dependency usage can be in the tables 4 and 5 above.

Only the last 40 entries are shown. The whole table can be found in the following CSV report:
`External_package_usage_per_artifact_distribution`

**Columns:**
- *artifactName* that contains the type that calls the external package
- *artifactTypes* the total count of types in the artifact
- *numberOfExternalPackages* the number of distinct external packages used
- *numberOfTypes* in the artifact where the *numberOfExternalPackages* applies
- *numberOfTypesPercentage* in the artifact where the *numberOfExternalPackages* applies in %

### Table 12 - External package usage per artifact grouped by number of internal packages

The following table shows the external package usage for every artifact grouped by the number of distinct internal dependent packages. The intention is to find external package usage spread across multiple internal packages in artifacts. 

Artifacts that encapsulate external dependency calls in one internal package overall (or each) are easier to change if those external dependencies change and are most likely applying a [Hexagonal architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture). Artifacts that use external dependencies in multiple internal packages need more effort to adapt to changes of those external dependencies. On one hand this could be intended e.g. when using standardized libraries. On the other hand this might indicate higher than necessary coupling.

The whole table can be found in the following CSV report:
`External_package_usage_per_internal_package_count`




<div>
<table border="1" class="dataframe">
  <thead>
    <tr style="text-align: right;">
      <th>artifactName</th>
    </tr>

### Table 13 - External package usage aggregated

This table lists all artifacts and their external package dependencies usage aggregated over internal packages. 

The intention behind this is to find artifacts that use an external dependency across multiple internal packages. This might be intended for frameworks and standardized libraries and helps to quantify how widely those are used. For some external dependencies it might be beneficial to only access it from one package and provide an abstraction for internal usage following a [Hexagonal architecture](https://alistair.cockburn.us/hexagonal-architecture). Thus, this table may also help in finding application for the Hexagonal architecture or similar approaches (Domain Driven Design Anti Corruption Layer). After all it is easier to update or replace such external dependencies when they are used in specific areas and not all over the code.

Only the last 40 entries are shown. The whole table can be found in the following CSV report:
`External_package_usage_per_artifact_package_aggregated`

**Columns:**
- *artifactName* that contains the type that calls the external package
- *artifactPackages* is the total count of packages in the artifact
- *artifactTypes* is the total count of types in the artifact
- *numberOfExternalPackages* the number of distinct external packages used
- *[min,max,med,avg,std]NumberOfPackages* provide statistics based on each external package and its package usage within the artifact
- *[min,max,med,avg,std]NumberOfPackagesPercentage* provide statistics in % based on each external package and its package usage within the artifact in respect to the overall count of packages in the artifact
- *[min,max,med,avg,std]NumberOfTypes* provide statistics based on each external package and its type usage within the artifact
- *[min,max,med,avg,std]NumberOfTypePercentage* provide statistics in % based on each external package and its type usage within the artifact in respect to the overall count of packages in the artifact
- *numberOfTypes* in the artifact where the *numberOfExternalPackages* applies
- *numberOfTypesPercentage* in the artifact where the *numberOfExternalPackages* applies in %

#### Table 13 Chart 1 - External package usage - max percentage of internal types

This chart shows per artifact the maximum percentage of internal packages (compared to all packages in that artifact) that use one specific external package. 

**Example:** One artifact might use 10 external packages where 7 of them are used in one internal package, 2 of them are used in two packages and one external dependency is used in 5 packages. So for this artifact there will be a point at x = 10 (external packages used by the artifact) and 5 (max internal packages). Instead of the count the percentage of internal packages compared to all packages in that artifact is used to get a normalized plot.

    No data to plot


#### Table 13 Chart 2 - External package usage - median percentage of internal types

This chart shows per artifact the median (0.5 percentile) of internal packages (compared to all packages in that artifact) that use one specific external package. 

**Example:** One artifact might use 9 external packages where 3 of them are used in 1 internal package, 3 of them are used in 2 package and the last 3 ones are used in 3 packages. So for this artifact there will be a point at x = 10 (external packages used by the artifact) and 2 (median internal packages). Instead of the count the percentage of internal packages compared to all packages in that artifact is used to get a normalized plot.
