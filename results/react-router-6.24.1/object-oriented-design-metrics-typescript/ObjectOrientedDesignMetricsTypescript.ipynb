    "## Outgoing Dependencies\n",
    "\n",
    "Outgoing dependencies are also denoted as \"Fan-out\", \"Efferent Coupling\" or \"out-degree\".\n",
    "These are the ones that are used by the listed package. \n",
    "\n",
    "Code from other packages and libraries you’re depending on (outgoing) might change over time. The more outgoing changes, the more likely and frequently code changes are needed. This involves time and effort which can be reduced by automation of tests and version updates. Automated tests are crucial to reveal updates, that change the behavior of the code unexpectedly (“fragile code”). As soon as more effort is required, keeping up becomes difficult (“rigid code”). Not being able to use a newer version might not only restrict features, it can get problematic if there are security issues. This might force you to take “fast but ugly” solutions into account which further increases technical dept.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since Java Packages are organized hierarchically, outgoing dependencies can be count for every package in isolation or by including all of its sub-packages. The latter one is done without top level packages like for example \"org\" or \"org.company\" by assuring that only packages are considered that have other packages or types in the same hierarchy level (\"siblings\")."
