## Hierarchical Artifact Dependencies

The following hierarchical graph shows artifact dependencies with the most used basis/shared artifact at the bottom and the artifact the builds upon the other dependencies on top. The visualization is limited to the first 60 nodes and their direct dependency ordered by the dependency layer ("maxDistanceFromSource") descending. 

For the whole list of topologically sorted artifacts including the hierarchical layer go to the report `TopologicalSortedArtifacts.csv`. This is also known as the "build order".
