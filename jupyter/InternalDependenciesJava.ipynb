Martin](http://staff.cs.utu.fi/~jounsmed/doos_06/material/DesignPrinciplesAndPatterns.pdf), the *Interface Segregation Principle* suggests that software components should have narrow, focused interfaces rather than large, general-purpose ones. The goal is to minimize the dependencies between components and increase modularity, flexibility, and maintainability.\n",
